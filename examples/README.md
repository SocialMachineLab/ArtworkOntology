# Artwork Object Ontology Examples

This document demonstrates how various artworks can be represented using the ARTO (ARTwork object Ontology) framework through concrete examples. Each example shows how both descriptive content and contextual information can be captured in a structured manner.


## Comparison Across Art Forms

These examples demonstrate how ARTO can be applied to diverse art forms while maintaining a consistent ontological framework:

| Artwork | Medium | Descriptive Focus | Contextual Focus |
|---------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Composition II | Abstract Painting | Geometric elements, colour relationships | De Stijl movement, modernism |
| The Thinker | Sculpture | Posture, physicality, bronze material | Gates of Hell commission |
| The Greeting | Video Art | Temporal sequence, emotional progression | Renaissance influence, technical specs |
| The Shepherdess | Painting | Rural figure, pastoral symbolism | 19th century French context |


Despite these artworks differing in medium and form, ARTO offers a unified representation method for all. Whether dealing with two-dimensional paintings, three-dimensional sculptures, or time-based video art, ARTO captures both their attributes and visual features. This flexibility makes ARTO a truly comprehensive artwork representation framework capable of adapting to the diversity and complexity of the art domain.


The complete RDF-star and RDF representations of these examples are available as `.ttl` files in this directory:

> **Note:** Some properties shown in the examples (e.g., `arto:talkTo`, `arto:whisper`, `arto:greets`, `arto:ignores`) are illustrative extensions used to demonstrate the expressive power of RDF-star for interaction modelling. They are **not** part of the core ARTO ontology (`arto.ttl`). For the official class and property definitions, please refer to the main ontology file [`arto.ttl`](../arto.ttl).

## The Shepherdess
![The picture of the artwork "The Shepherdess"](../images/example.jpg)

"The Shepherdess", also known as "The Little Shepherdess", is a painting by William-Adolphe Bouguereau completed in 1889. The title is taken from the Southern French dialect. The painting depicts an idyllic, pastoral scene of a lone young woman in peasant attire posed for the artist, balancing a stick (likely her crook) across her shoulders, standing barefooted in the foreground. In the background are oxen grazing in a field.
