# Artwork Object Ontology Examples

This document demonstrates how various artworks can be represented using the ARTO (ARTwork object Ontology) framework through concrete examples. Each example shows how both descriptive content and contextual information can be captured in a structured manner.


## The Shepherdess

"The Shepherdess", also known as "The Little Shepherdess", is a painting by William-Adolphe Bouguereau completed in 1889. The title is taken from the Southern French dialect. The painting depicts an idyllic, pastoral scene of a lone young woman in peasant attire posed for the artist, balancing a stick (likely her crook) across her shoulders, standing barefooted in the foreground. In the background are oxen grazing in a field.

## Comparison Across Art Forms

These examples demonstrate how ARTO can be applied to diverse art forms while maintaining a consistent ontological framework:

| Artwork | Medium | Descriptive Focus | Contextual Focus |
|---------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| The Shepherdess | Painting | Rural figure, pastoral symbolism | 19th century French context |
| Composition II | Abstract Painting | Geometric elements, color relationships | De Stijl movement, modernism |
| The Thinker | Sculpture | Posture, physicality, bronze material | Gates of Hell commission |
| The Greeting | Video Art | Temporal sequence, emotional progression | Renaissance influence, technical specs |

By applying the same ontological framework across different art forms, ARTO enables structured representation that captures both the unique aspects of each medium and the universal elements of artistic expression.
