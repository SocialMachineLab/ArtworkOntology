# Artwork Object Ontology (ARTO)

The Artwork Object Ontology (ARTO) is a comprehensive ontology designed for describing and contextualizing artworks. It consists of two main components: the Artwork Descriptive Model and the Artwork Contextual Model. ARTO aims to provide a structured and detailed representation of artworks, facilitating tasks such as artwork captioning and information retrieval.


## Features

- Artwork Descriptive Model: Represents the artistic expression of artworks, including visual elements, scenes, and emotions.
- Artwork Contextual Model: Captures background information such as artwork metadata, historical framework, and related events.
- Data-driven approach: The ontology is built based on existing available data and incorporates concepts from established cultural heritage ontologies like CIDOC-CRM and EDM.
- Evaluation: The ontology has been validated using the OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner (OOPS!) and refined through interviews with art experts.
- Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs): ARTO can be integrated with LLMs to enable automated artwork captioning.
