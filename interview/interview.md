# Analysis of Art Expert Interviews on Describing Artworks

## Introduction

This document presents an analysis of interviews conducted with art experts to validate our designed ontology and gain insights into the processes employed by experts when creating captions for artworks. By presenting the ontology to the experts and soliciting their feedback, we aim to evaluate its accuracy and completeness and cover the art domain knowledge, ensuring its practical applicability. Additionally, the interviews will explore their thought processes, methodologies, and decision-making steps used by experts when analysing and describing various aspects of artworks. The insights gained will not only refine our ontology but also guide the process of automated captioning for generating accurate, meaningful, and contextually relevant captions, enhancing the accessibility and understanding of artworks.



## Interview Process

1. Participants will be asked to create captions for examples of four artworks and verbalize their thought processes.

2. After writing the captions, participants will be presented with the definitions of different types of captions ('Descriptive', 'Contextual', or 'Interpretative') and asked to label each part of their captions accordingly.

3. Participants will be asked a series of questions (approximately 15, with possible follow-ups) to better understand the reasoning behind their opinions and thought processes.

4. Participants will be asked to evaluate our proposed Artwork Object Ontology.

## Participant Information

The participants in this research will consist of individuals who are over 18 years old and have art backgrounds. The expected number of participants is 20.

## Interview Questions

The following key questions will be asked during the interviews to clarify the experts' thought processes (detailed questions can be found in the file [Art Expert Interview](/interview/Art%20Expert%20Interview.pdf)):

1. What aspects do you focus on when writing captions for paintings? 
2. Did you follow an order of relevance when describing the paintings?
3. How to Deal with the Subjectivity of Captions
4. What are the related factors that affect emotions?
5. What background events should be mentioned?
6. What aspects are more challenging?

## Interview Results Summary

The interviews with art experts provide valuable insights into the process of creating captions for artworks. The findings reveal that experts consider various aspects of artwork captioning, such as the artist's background, the artwork's context, visual content, and interpretations. The importance and order of these aspects vary among experts. Most agree that subjectivity in interpretations is hard to avoid and could be minimized through understanding the artist's intentions and context. Challenges in caption creation include maintaining a professional perspective, comprehending the artist's true intentions, and knowing relevant background facts. Our ontology was generally well-received, with a focus on including rich backgrounds and visual content.
